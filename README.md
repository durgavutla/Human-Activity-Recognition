Human Activity Recognition
Recognition of human activity is an ability to interpret the gestures or movements of the human body via sensors and to determine human activity or action. Most everyday human tasks can be simplified or automated if they can be recognized through the activity recognizing systems. Generally, the human activity recognition system may or may not be supervised.

The recognition of human activity is mainly used in health systems installed in the residential environment, hospitals and rehabilitation centres. It is widely used to monitor the activities of the elderly staying in rehabilitation centres for chronic disease management and disease prevention.

In the section below, I will take you through a Machine Learning project on Human Activity Recognition using the smartphone data and the Python programming language.

I import NumPy and pandas to manage tables and datasets. Then matplotlib is included to be used to create visualizations. To use various machine learning algorithms, I import SVM, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier provided by Scikit-Learn. Also, accuracy_score is included to calculate the accuracy of the Activity Recognition Model.

So we can clearly see that the Logistic Regression model performs the best for the task of Human Activity Recognition with Machine Learning.
